                        <p>
                           As a value-based Clinic Software solutions provider, we consider ourselves health workers on a mission: to support health-industry stakeholders with the technical tools necessary to eradicate barriers to healthcare access.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kenya’s healthcare landscape is characterized by extreme regional differences in the quality and distribution of care, with the best facilities located in its capital Nairobi, while the most underdeveloped facilities are in the North-Eastern Province and parts of the coastal region.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Primary care facilities in rural areas often suffer from shortages of staff, essential drugs, and basic medical equipment. Some patients choose not to seek care due to the distance that they would have to travel to reach the nearest health facility. Only 30% of the rural population has access to health facilities within 4km of their home, compared with 70% of the urban population. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Accordingly, our technology also offers Telehealth and Telemedicine services to health organizations and medical personnel, who share our vision of equalizing access to healthcare by those in underserved communities. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In line with our commitment towards achieving Universal Healthcare Coverage, My Daktari mHealth is Telehealth-enabled, meaning that health providers signed up on the platform can begin or continue offering their patients non-clinic facility care or home-based care.

                                            <p>Synchronous telehealth refers to live, real-time communication between a patient and healthcare provider. This can include virtual visits conducted over video or phone, where the patient and provider can see and/or hear each other in real-time.
                                        Synchronous telehealth allows for immediate interaction and feedback between the patient and provider. It can be used for a wide range of healthcare services, including primary care consultations, specialist consultations, and mental health counseling.

                                              Asynchronous telehealth, also known as “store-and-forward,” is a type of communication between a patient and healthcare provider that is not live. In asynchronous telehealth, the patient sends information to the provider and it is stored until the provider has the opportunity to review it
                                                This type of telehealth is often used for patient intake or follow-up care. For example, a patient might send a photo of a skin condition that is later reviewed by a dermatologist who recommends treatment

                                                services allow patients to receive healthcare services remotely from the comfort of their own homes. This can include virtual visits with healthcare providers, remote patient monitoring, and asynchronous communication with providers.
Home-based telehealth services can make healthcare more accessible for people who live in remote areas or have mobility limitations. It can also help keep patients safe if they have an infectious disease such as COVID-19.
Some examples of home-based telehealth services include virtual visits with healthcare providers through video or phone chats, remote patient monitoring where measurements such as weight or blood pressure are sent to the healthcare provider, and asynchronous communication where data, images, or messages are recorded to share with the doctor later.
